* java don't have sizeof() function like c++.
* empty class is allocated with 1 byte if memory space
* Padding ensures that fields are aligned properly in memory but can lead to wasted space if not managed efficiently.
* Greedy alignment attempts to optimize the layout of fields to reduce padding while ensuring the memory alignment rules are followed.
eg:  Fields are arranged by the JVM according to their size to minimize the need for padding.
     Typically, larger fields (e.g., long or double) are placed first, followed by smaller fields (int, short, byte).
     This strategy reduces the total memory footprint by minimizing the number of unused padding bytes.
* after declaring parameterized / non-parameterized constructor, the default constructor dies.
* Java avoids creating a default copy constructor because shallow copying (copying references for objects)
  might not be sufficient or safe for certain cases.
  Complex objects with deep data structures often need custom logic to ensure proper copying (deep copying).

* Use public when you want the field or method to be freely accessible by all classes.
* Use protected when you need to allow inheritance and package-level access but still maintain some level of encapsulation from non-subclass external classes.
* Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes directly (to avoid the diamond problem). However, it supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.
